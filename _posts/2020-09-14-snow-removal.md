We don't require a deposit. You pay 1/4 of the seasonal fee at the end of November, December, January and February. For sign ups after November, you'll pay 1/3 of the fee at the end of December, January and February. There is no discount for late registrants

## Cost
We don't compete on price, so if you're looking for a great deal, then keep looking

## New Clients
We are only taking on a handful of new clients for the 2020 winter season provided they reside in the Service Area (see above)

## The 2020/2021 Season
Any seasonal quote covers the period between November 1 and April 7. Prices include salt for asphalt and de-icer for stonework

## Peace of Mind
We clear your snow no matter how much falls. Between snowfalls we touch up your property to remove the plow windrow and clear away ice chunks. You can call or text us any time of day or night
