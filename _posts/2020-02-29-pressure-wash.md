### Special process
Our multi stage process has been battle tested to ensure your restored interlock or cobblestone driveway stays weed free as long as possible

  1) Identify & map the types of weeds you have
  2) Burn off surface weeds with a powerful propane torch
  3) pressure wash existing sand and weeds
  4) Apply acetic acid & borax to root propagating weed areas (violets, dandylions etc)
  5 Burn off any exposed weed roots with torch
  6) Apply chosen sand: silica, polymer or Enviro Bond
  7) Plate compact sand
  8) Set sand with water
  8) Optional seal (wetlook, low or medium gloss)

## Free 2 year maintenance
We monitor your driveway at no cost for the next 2 seasons and keep it looking like new. Any new weeds are dealt with. Any failed sections are redone at no cost to you
