### Special process
Our multi stage process has been battle tested to ensure your restored interlock or cobblestone driveway stays weed free as long as possible

  1. Identify & map the types of weeds you have
  2. Burn off surface weeds with a powerful propane torch
  3. Pressure wash to remove old sand
  4. Apply acetic acid & borax to root propagating weed areas (violets, dandelions etc)
  5. Burn off any exposed weed roots with torch
  6. Apply chosen sand: silica, polymer or Enviro Bond
  7. Plate compact sand
  8. Mist sand with water
  9. Optional seal (wetlook, low or medium gloss)

## Free 2 year maintenance
We monitor your driveway at no cost for the next 2 seasons and keep it looking like new. Any new weeds are dealt with. Any failed sections are redone at no cost to you
