## Open on Holidays
We are open on Dec 24, 25, 26, 31 and Jan 1 unless the day follows a Snow Day

It may be difficult to deliver larger trees on holidays due to giving our Tree Elves a day off

## Snow Days
We do not deliver on days after a snowfall in order to service our snow removal customers

### Tree Season
We are offering trees from December to January 7 (Orthodox Christmas)

## Selection
We are currently offering fresh cut Balsam Fir (flat or pencil point) trees in various heights

Call, text or email us to discuss special requests

Pick and choose delivery plus optional stand, setup, takedown & cleanup

## Setup Service
Get a nice fresh tree delivered, setup and taken down with full cleanup. All you have to do is decorate it

We setup your tree where you want it, then take it down and cut it up for reuse and recycling

## Takedown and Cleanup Service
We make sure not a single needle is left in your home

## Keep it Green
If you opt for the takedown service, we recycle your tree. All tree branches are sent to municipal compost facilities, while the wood is cured and used for fence posts or other projects
