## Service Area
Lawn and garden care is available in Toronto West of Yonge street to the border of Mississauga

## All Electric
We use the latest battery powered equipment to cut your grass so we don't disturb your neighbours with loud and smelly gas engines

### No Overkill
Running gas powered backpack blowers to clean up grass trimmings is overkill. Our blowers are battery powered and won't disturb the neighbours

## Trimmers
Our battery powered trimmers only make noise when cutting, unlike gas powered trimmers that must run the engine until the job is complete

### Extra Quiet
Our trimmers use state of the art string that is engineered for silence. Grooves are cut into the string that reduce wind resistance and thus noise

## Gas exceptions

### Fall Cleanup
We use gas leaf blowers only in late fall for large leaf collection jobs where electric blowers just don't have enough power to do the job
